Git-Training
============

There was a recent discussion over at one of Linus Torvalds' pull requests - rather, someone requested a pull on the Linux kernel through Githubs pull request option on the website - and Linus was making some very insightful objections about the current way the Github website creates pull requests.

You can read the whole discussion [here](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/17#issuecomment-5654674). It's actually very interesting. Linus has been a developer for so many years that he developed a certain standard on how pull requests and commits should be formated. The guidelines have been on [git.kernel.org](http://git.kernel.org/?p=git/git.git;a=blob;f=Documentation/SubmittingPatches;h=ece3c77482b3ff006b973f1ed90b708e26556862;hb=HEAD) for years and they make a lot of sense.
